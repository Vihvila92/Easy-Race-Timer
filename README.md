## üéÆ Use Cases

### Small Competition (1 computer)

1. Start Docker Compose
2. Open browser -> master computer serves all roles
3. Add competitors
4. Record times with button presses
5. Display results

### Large Competition (multiple computers)

1. **Master computer**: Login with admin role -> management view
2. **Start computer**: Login with start role -> start view opens automatically
3. **Finish computer**: Login with finish role -> finish view opens automatically
4. **Announcement computer**: Login with display role -> results display opens automatically
5. Everything synchronizes in real-time via WebSocket connections

**Note**: All client computers use the same React application with different views

## üë§ Role-Based User Interface

### User Roles

- **Admin**: Main user, all features available
- **Start**: Start time recording and competitor management
- **Finish**: Finish time recording
- **Display**: Results and information display for audience
- **Timer**: General timing role (start + finish)

### Automatic View Selection

1. **Login**: User enters credentials
2. **Role Recognition**: System identifies user's role
3. **View Routing**: Browser automatically navigates to the correct view
4. **Restricted Functions**: User sees only functions relevant to their role

### Flexibility

- **Admin users**: Can choose their preferred view
- **Role switching**: Possible to change role by re-logging in
- **Mobile support**: All views work on mobile devices as well

## üîß Development Principles

1. **Don't Reinvent the Wheel**: Use existing components and libraries
2. **Modularity**: Components isolated and reusable
3. **DRY Principle**: Minimize code repetition
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add features gradually
5. **Future-Proof**: Keep architecture open for future extensions

## üåê Language Support and Internationalization

### Built-in Languages

- **Finnish (FI)**: Primary language and development language
- **English (EN)**: International use, built-in

### Technical Implementation

- **React i18n**: Internationalization in React components
- **Backend i18n**: API messages and error texts in both languages
- **User Choice**: Language selectable from user interface
- **Dynamic Switching**: Language can be changed on the fly

### Future Language Extensions

- Community translations
- Additional languages as needed (Swedish, German, etc.)
- Translation tool integration

### Documentation Language Support

- **README**: Finnish (primary) + English (README_EN.md)
- **API Documentation**: English (international standard)
- **User Guides**: Both languages
- **Code Comments**: English (developer-friendly)

## üìù Notes

- Database stays lightweight, but system must scale to larger competitions
- Speed is critical - no delays during timing
- Offline operation important (network interruptions must not affect timing)
- User interface must be intuitive even in stressful situations

## üöß Development Status

**Current Phase**: Project planning and basic structure creation

**Next Steps**:

1. Backend API skeleton
2. React frontend foundation
3. First working timing prototype
